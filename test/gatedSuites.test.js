// Governance concern, raised in all five reviews of the workspace
// candidate and never turned into a finding because nothing is broken:
// `npm test` reports "skipped 2" while five whole suites carry a SKIP
// directive, and the five include BOTH adversarial suites and BOTH
// live-AI suites. A reader of that summary reasonably concludes that
// almost everything ran. The important things had not.
//
// Node's counter is not wrong, it is counting something else: a suite
// gated at the `describe`/`test` level reports as one passing entry with
// a SKIP directive attached, and only some shapes land in the skipped
// tally. Rather than argue with the runner, this file states the truth
// separately, every run, where it cannot be missed.
//
// It also fails if a NEW gated suite appears without being listed here,
// so the honest summary cannot quietly fall behind the test tree - the
// same drift guard used elsewhere in this codebase for VALID_TEMPLATES
// and the permission maps.
